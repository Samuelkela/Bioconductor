# Bioconductor--R

BIOCONDUCTORÂ¶
Bioconductor is quite more advanced compared to say Biopython & requires minimal programming on the user end.
I've covered some basic sequence operations in a biopython notebook or Working with Sequences noteobook on a relatable topic.
The libraries used in this notebook:

(I) Biostrings ( General base library for work with strings, uses FASTA for imports )
(II) msa ( Library for multiple sequence alignment, containing more advanced methods than the progressive approach covered in biological sequence alignment )
